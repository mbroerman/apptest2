<h2>Act Out the Brutal 'Game of Thrones' Series With These Adorable Figurines</h2>
<h5>JANUARY 21, 2013</h5>
<p>Pssst. Hey, buddy. Feel like acting out the action-packed - and often incredibly grim and brutal - scenes in Game of Thrones? We've got the most adorably incongruous toys for that.</p>

<p>After releasing a series of vinyl figurines last year that included Tyrion Lannister, Daenerys Targaryen, and Ned Stark, collectibles-maker Funko now has a new series that includes Jon Snow, Cersei Lannister, Robb Stark, Jaime Lannister, Arya Stark, and Renley Baratheon, all rendered fantastic vinyl cuteness ready to help you recreate the gruesome battles and beheadings of the HBO drama (and book series) any time you feel the urge to get your Joffrey on.</p>

<p>Each figure is 3.75-inches tall and has the tell-tale signs of his or her character - Targaryen comes with a dragon on her arm, The Hound bears a facial scar, and Khal Drogo has his badass tattoos. Many, like Robb Stark and Jaime Lannister, even come battle-ready with swords in their hands, just waiting to be soaked in the blood of their enemies.</p>

<p>Check out all of the figurines in the gallery above. The first series of the vinyl characters is available now through the HBO online store for $10 each. The second series is currently available for pre-order and will ship on April 30. Order now and prepare to get busted Lord-Helmet-in-Spaceballs-style while reenacting some fanfic.</p>
